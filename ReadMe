Install minikube  to serve as a K8S cluster
https://github.com/amolshete/Minikube-Installation

Create a docker container that would containerize Jupyter/JupyterLab(JupyterLab is an open-source, web-based interactive development environment (IDE) for working with Jupyter notebooks, code, and data.)
Build the container with the following additional content:
opencv-python kubernetes swat saspy xgboost scikit-learn matplotlib lightgbm
docker build -t jupyter-ml-lab:latest .

Test the container locally.
docker run -it --rm -p 8888:8888 jupyter-ml-lab

Push the newly built container to a registry.
docker tag jupyter-ml-lab:latest <your_dockerhub_username>/jupyter-ml-lab:latest
docker login
Push the image
docker push pragatikoyande/jupyter-ml-lab:latest

Deploy the newly built container to K8S.
Start Minikube (Kubernetes cluster)

Create dedicated namespace
Create a service to be exposed on port 8888.
Create a deployment.
Create a configmap to be exposed in the pod. Any name is fine.
Create a secret. Any name is fine.
Deploy to K8S
Files are present

kubectl get all -n jupyter-ml
Show accessing the K8S pod on the correct port.

minikube service -n jupyter-ml jupyter-lab-service --url
sg add port 3000 - Port forwarding is needed when you want a device outside your local network (e.g., the internet) to access a service running inside your private network.
kubectl port-forward -n jupyter-ml svc/jupyter-lab-service 3000:8888 --address 0.0.0.0 &
connects port 3000 on your machine
to port 8888 of the jupyter-lab-service inside the Kubernetes cluster
makes it accessible from any IP (0.0.0.0)
and runs the command in the background (&)

Collect the K8S log to verify the output
kubectl logs <pod_name> -n jupyter-ml
